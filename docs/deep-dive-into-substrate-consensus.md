# Deep dive into Substrate consensus

Blockchains essentially record data in multiple _computers_. As a result, it
needs an approach to ensure that at any given point in time, recorded data will
continue to exist without any modification.

A consensus mechanism describes who can permanently record data, a provides
guarantee that the data will continue to exist in its original form.

In this guide, we will review important blockchain consensus concepts and
navigate how a couple of consensus components are implemented in Substrate. We
will highlight some code and explain how different components fit together.

## Summary

We were able to get a firm grasp of the concept of blockchain consensus within
the framework of Substrate. We appreciated how Substrate implemented
out-of-the-box consensus mechanisms and gained insight into relevant Substrate
consensus modules.

We developed an understanding of the following:
