# Networking in Substrate

Blockchains are made of a distributed network of computers interacting in a
harmonious symphony. This network facilitates the identification of network
participants as well as communication among network participants.

Substrate comes out of the box with a suite of customizable network stacks that
describe and facilitate how a blockchain network can be created, how new
participants join, and how different kinds of network information are
distributed among network participants.

In this guide, we dive into substrate network stack. The first part of this
guide covers generic network functionalities including network creation,
growth, and topology. The second part of the series will cover
consensus-specific network protocols.
