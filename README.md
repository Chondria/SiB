# Substrate in Bits

![Substrate in Bits](https://github.com/Chondria/SiB/blob/main/Images/sibbb.png)


Substrate in Bits is a technical content series/reference aimed at solving the pain points of developers building with Substrate and Rust. The content is designed to go in-depth on some of the common issues faced by developers and provide practical solutions to those issues. This repository contains the [code samples](https://github.com/Chondria/SiB/tree/main/Sandbox), [tutorials](https://github.com/Chondria/SiB/tree/main/docs), and other resources associated with the series.

## Getting started
To get started with Substrate in Bits, you can browse the available content on the [doc](https://github.com/Chondria/SiB/tree/main/docs) folder or the table below. Substrate in Bits content will also be available on [Polkadot.study](https://polkadot.study). You can clone the repository to your local machine and run the examples to get a better understanding of the concepts discussed in the series.

## Code samples
Each Substrate in Bits content comes with a folder containing all the code and programs used in that content. These code samples can be found in the [Sandbox](https://github.com/Chondria/SiB/tree/main/Sandbox) folder are designed to help you understand the concepts discussed in the content and try them out for yourself. 

### Directory Structure
The directory strcuture for the code samples are as follows

```
│── Sandbox 
   └──ABOUT.md
   │── content-name
   │   ├── codes
   │   └──README.md 
```
The **content-name** folder is named after the title of the technical content, and contains:
- The `codes` folder: This contains all the codes and programs used for that content
- `README.md`: a README file that describes how to set up and use the code samples.

### Using the code samples
To use the code samples, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Chondria/SiB.git`
2. Navigate to the `sandbox` directory: `cd sandbox`
3. Navigate to the folder for the specific content you are interested in: `cd [content-name]` replace `[content-name]` with the name of the technical content (This links to the specific repository for that project)
4. Follow the instructions in the `README.md` file to build and run the example program.

By following these steps, you can test out the code samples for each Substrate in Bits content and gain a better understanding of the concepts discussed in the series.
