# Substrate in Bits

![Substrate in Bits](./Images/sibbb.png)

Substrate in Bits is a technical content series/reference aimed at solving the pain points of developers building with Substrate and Rust. The content is designed to go in-depth on some of the common issues faced by developers and provide practical solutions to those issues. This repository contains the [code samples](https://github.com/Chondria/SiB/tree/main/Sandbox), [tutorials](https://github.com/Chondria/SiB/tree/main/docs), and other resources associated with the series.

## Getting started

To get started with Substrate in Bits, you can browse the available content on the [doc](https://github.com/Chondria/SiB/tree/main/docs) folder or the table below. Substrate in Bits content will also be available on [Polkadot.study](https://polkadot.study). You can clone the repository to your local machine and run the examples to get a better understanding of the concepts discussed in the series.

## Code samples

Each Substrate in Bits content comes with its own repository containing all the code and programs used in that content. These code samples are designed to help you understand the concepts discussed in the content and try them out for yourself.

### Using the code samples

To use the code samples, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository for the specific guide/tutorial.
2. Navigate to the repository's directory: `cd [name of repo]`
3. Follow the instructions in the guide or the `README.md` file of the code sample repository to build and run the example program.

By following these steps, you can test out the code samples for each Substrate in Bits content and gain a better understanding of the concepts discussed in the series.
